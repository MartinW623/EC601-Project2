# EC601-Project2

This is the second project of EC601. I will use Twitter API to obtain data for analysis.

I used tweepy to finish this assignment because professor Alshaykh suggested using python to complete.

This project includes a testing file and a result file. The testing file is the function to download your home timeline tweets and print each one of their texts to the console. The result file is the results of the home timeline tweets.

Really appreciate Zanming Huang's help for making me understand the knowledge of programming and systems more clearly.
