# EC601-Project2
### Product Mission：

This product is designed to help users easily obtain information on public platforms such as Twitter and perform sentiment analysis on the content of Twitter texts.

### User stories：

As a social science researcher, I want to study the emotions expressed by the messages sent by the public on public platforms.

As a parent, I want to judge whether my children who have just entered elementary school will be exposed to electronic devices and social media in advance will be badly affected and induced.

As a politician, I hope to know what the public is most concerned about and what the mainstream views of different politicians and events are.

As a company's decision-maker, I hope that after our company launches a new product, we can get the most authentic user experience from the public.

As a content creator, I need to know the most popular elements at the moment, and to understand people’s views on different popular elements.

### MVP

Users can obtain information on the public social media Twitter, and perform sentiment analysis.

### Assignment

This is the second project of EC601. I will use Twitter API and Google NLP API to obtain data and analyze.

I used tweepy to finish the twitter analysis tool because professor suggested using python to complete.

This project includes testing files and result fileS. The testing file is the function to download your home timeline tweets and print each one of their texts to the console. The result file is the results of the home timeline tweets.
